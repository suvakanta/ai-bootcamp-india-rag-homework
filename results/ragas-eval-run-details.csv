 'Vestibulum non consequat sem.']","Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.","Parameters and weights in a neural network play a crucial role in the functioning of the network by determining how the network processes input data to make predictions. They are dispersed throughout the neural network and are adjusted during training to learn relationships within the data. The parameters help the network predict the next word in a sequence, effectively compressing knowledge about the world into the weights, which allows the network to perform tasks like next word prediction accurately.",,,,,
